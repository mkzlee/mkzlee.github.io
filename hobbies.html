I like to read nonfiction books, often about health and medicine, but I've also a serious penchant for non-romance stories with romance and stories where the main character has moral dilemmas. My all-time favourites are the following:</p> 
                <br><dl class="row"><!--Bootstrap Description List Start--><!--Sorry for shitty summaries-->
                  <dt class="col-sm-3"><i>The Saga of the Seven Suns</i>, by Kevin J. Anderson</dt>
                  <dd class="col-sm-9">A seven-book-long fiction series where aliens wage war on humans after humans accidentally blew up one of their planets. Involves romance, corrupt government and is a rather peculiar story. It switches POV between dozens of characters to give perspective on the decisions made by each side.</dd>
                
                  <dt class="col-sm-3"><i>Divergent</i>, by Veronica Roth</dt>
                  <dd class="col-sm-9">A trilogy of fiction novels where a girl breaks free of society by moving to a different culture, location and family than the one she grew up in. She, her friends and her boyfriend try to exit the boundaries of their dystopian world.</dd>
                
                  <dt class="col-sm-3"><i>The Mortality Doctrine</i>, by James Dashner</dt>
                  <dd class="col-sm-9">A trilogy of fiction novels where there is a digital world that most teens spend the majority of their time in. The digital world, filled with games and rewards, is more dangerous than it seems. One of the only books I've read with an impactful major character death, and my second favourite dystopian novel.</dd>
                
                  <dt class="col-sm-3"><i>The Shadow Games</i>, by Amanda Foody</dt>
                  <dd class="col-sm-9">A trilogy of fictitious books where a well-mannered girl moves to a new city ruled by gangs in search of her missing mother. She and the Irons gang are dragged into a card game where if you lose, you die. The cutthroat and unpredictible environment coupled with the subtle but important magic system quickly cemented this series as one of my favourites.</dd>
                
                  <dt class="col-sm-3"><i>The Inheritance Games</i>, by Jennifer Lynn Barnes</dt>
                  <dd class="col-sm-9">This trilogy is about a normal teenager who is revealed to be the sole inheritor of a multi-billionaire. To obtain this money, she is required to live on the estate with the dead man's family for one year. The dead billionaire left puzzles and mysteries everywhere, which Avery and the billionaire's grandchildren scramble to solve. I liked how the protaganist wasn't special in any way, and was often on the completely wrong page.</dd>

                  <dt class="col-sm-3"><i>The Naturals</i>, by Jennifer Lynn Barnes</dt>
                  <dd class="col-sm-9">The Naturals is a story about a girl with a natural talent for reading others. She is recruited by the government into a group filled with people like her and works to solve unsolvable crimes.</dd>

                <br><p>All of these books are really special to me, but I read each several years ago so my memories are not very clear. In fact, I read them so long ago that <i>The Saga of the Seven Suns</i> got a whole three-book prequel while <i>The Shadow Games</i> and <i>The Inheritance Games</i> both got a third and final book in the form of <i>Queen of Volts</i> and <i>The Final Gambit</i>, respectively.</p>
